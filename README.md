# MTRK Viewer - MRI Pulse Sequence Visualization Software

MTRK Viewer is a powerful MRI pulse sequence visualization software that allows you to visualize custom pulse sequences for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiments.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the MTRK viewer on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the MTRK Viewer repository to your local machine using Git:


`git clone https://github.com/mtrk-dev/mtrk_viewer.git`

### 2. Open the Repository in Visual Studio Code
Open the repository in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

### 3. Download the VS Code Extension - "Live Server"
To run the MTRK viewer application, you'll need the "Live Server" extension for VS Code. You can install it from the Visual Studio Code marketplace by following these steps:
* Open VS Code.
* Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
* Search for "Live Server" in the Extensions Marketplace.
* Click the "Install" button for the Live Server extension.

### 4. Start the Live Server
Once you have the "Live Server" extension installed, you can use it to run the MTRK web application. Here's how:
* Open the `index.html` file in the MTRK repository.
* Right-click anywhere in the index.html file.
* Select "Open with Live Server."
* After doing this, your default web browser should automatically open, displaying the MTRK web application.

### Note

You can change the variable `reps` value in the `index.html` file. That will repeat the block sequence as many times as the value.
